Let's outline the steps to build a real-time email synchronization project using IMAP.(Below I mentioned tools which is used for my project)

1. Project Architecture:
 * IMAP Client: This component will handle the IMAP connection, fetching emails, and checking for new emails.  It will be written in Python (using imaplib).
   
 * Message Queue (MQ): A message queue (RabbitMQ) will decouple the IMAP client from the processing logic.  When the IMAP client finds new emails, it publishes the email data (or a message containing relevant information) to the MQ.
   
 * Email Processor: This component consumes messages from the MQ.  It performs the actual processing of the emails (parsing, storing in a database, triggering actions, etc.).  It can be written in Python.
   
 * Database: A database (PostgreSQL) to store the processed email data.
